  {title: 'What is the Wanchain project?',
    describe: 'Wanchain aims to build a distributed future "bank." As a distributed digital-asset based financial infrastructure, Wanchain allows any institution or individual to set up their own virtual teller window in the “bank” and provide services such as loan origination, asset exchanges, credit payments and transaction settlements based on digital assets. To be more precise, Wanchain is a distributed super financial market based on blockchain.'
  },
  {title: 'What problems does this project solve?',
    describe: 'As more and more digital currencies come online, digital assets appreciate in value and the need for exchanges and transactions among different digital assets keeps growing. This is the key reason why there are so many exchanges and wallet applications. But these exchanges and wallets are mostly operated in a centralized way. Value exchanged between different digital assets with a distributed approach will be a long term goal in the blockchain and digital economy, just as traditional banks are important in the current economic system. Wanchain is one of the solutions. '
  },
  {title: 'What is the technological path of Wanchain?',
    describe: 'Wanchain is a public blockchain developed in Go. Technically, its development is based on Ethereum. The main goal of Wanchain is to solve the issue of value transfers between different ledgers. Therefore, from a technical perspective, we have developed an original cross-chain mechanism, to become the first to use one-time addresses and ring-signatures to make privacy protection possible. We have achieved proof-of-concept privacy protection based on one-time addresses and ring-signatures, and will make this function available when version 1.0 of Wanchain is online. Later, we will implement cross-chain transactions among Wanchain, Ethereum and Bitcoin, as well as the cross-chain transactions of consortium blockchains that are developed based on Wanchain. '
  },
  {title: 'What are the applications of Wanchain?',
    describe: 'Most financial applications in the traditional world can be implemented on Wanchain, with the only difference being that they will be distributed applications based on digital currencies and digital assets. The applications include distributed exchanges, deposits and loans, payments and settlements, credit cards based on digital currencies, and ICOs supporting multiple cryptocurrencies. On Wanchain, more individuals and institutions will be able to provide distributed financial services based on digital currencies and assets.'

  {title: 'What is the relationship between Wanchain and Wanglu Tech?',
    describe: 'The Wanchain Foundation, registered in Singapore, is a non-profit organization that serves the Wanchain community. It is responsible for raising operating funds for the Wanchain community and offering support to enterprises, organizations and individuals. The foundation supports the Wanchain open-source project. It formulates fund-raising plans and institutes rules for using the corresponding funds.' +
    'Wanglu Tech is a for-profit company specializing in R&D and commercialization of the underlying blockchain technologies. River Capital and Fenbushi Capital have both invested in the company. The Wanchain theories and partial implementation are attributed to the Wanglu Tech team, which applies its prior R&D achievements to the Wanchain open-source project and is a participant of the Wanchain open-source community. Later, the Wanglu Tech team will continue to develop commercial blockchain applications in financial and other relevant areas and to build consortium blockchains for a diverse Wanchain ecological system. '

  {title: 'When did the preparation for the Wanchain project start? ',
    describe: 'When it comes to the origin of Wanchain, we have to mention that we proposed a method for dividing zones and layers for multiple blockchains when we were engaged at Factom. This method was mainly for solving performance problems of a single blockchain. The method was later learned of and used by many projects including the UK national digital currency prototype. Blockchain technology to this point has generated many blockchains which will continue to grow rapidly in number. Interactions between different blockchains, called “cross-chains”, is equivalent in nature of connecting many different chains to the same master chain. It should be noted that our team has been continuously accumulating experience and researching new methods to use in cross-chain technology, and the Wanchain project was created based on this. ' +
    'Our team has been devoted to the research and development of cryptography used in blockchain applications. The proof for privacy protection of smart contract tokens based on one-time addresses and ring-signatures was completed in 2016 and the proof-of-concept was completed in early 2017.'
  },
  {title: 'Who are the core developers for Wanchain? What are their specific jobs? Is the core development work done in the United States or China?',
    describe: 'Our core developers are from both China and the United States. In terms of specific tasks, our scientific team, led by Mr. Zane Liang, a PhD in applied mathematics, is in the United States and is mainly responsible for theoretical solutions and verification of the blockchain encryption algorithms. The engineering team led by Mr. Jack Lu consists of members in both China and the United States, depending on the tasks. '
  },
  {title: 'Are the tokens from this crowdfunding venture permitted to be transferred to other accounts?',
    describe: "Yes. After the crowdfunding venture is finished, tokens will be allocated to the users' Ethereum wallets, through which transfers are possible. This is similar to the transfer of smart contract tokens on Ethereum."
  },
  {title: 'When will the tokens from crowd-funding be transformed to the primary currency of Wanchain? ',
    describe: 'The tokens will be transformed to the primary currency when Wanchain officially goes online. It is expected that Wanchain version 1.0 will go live by the end of 2017.'
  },
  {title: 'What can Wancoin, the primary currency of Wanchain, be used for after Wanchain is online?',
    describe: `Two main roles for the Wancoin are: 1) process fees for Wanchain transactions and cross-chain transactions and, 2) bond deposits at each node for ensuring cross-chain transactions. In terms of applications, as more and more cross-chain transactions are processed by Wanchain and as Wancoin appreciates in value, Wancoin will become an intermediate currency for currency exchanges. This is similar to being the transaction medium for other currencies or digital assets.`
